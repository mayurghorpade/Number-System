Number System

A number system is a mathematical framework used to represent and express numeric values. It defines a set of digits and rules that determine how numbers are written, interpreted, and manipulated. Each number system is identified by its base (radix), which indicates how many unique digits it uses.

Every digit in a number has a place value, determined by the base raised to a positional power. This positional notation allows large and complex numbers to be represented efficiently.

Common Number Systems
1. Decimal (Base 10)

The most widely used number system in daily life.
Digits: 0–9
Example:
325 = 3×10² + 2×10¹ + 5×10⁰

2. Binary (Base 2)

Fundamental to computers and digital electronics.
Digits: 0, 1
Example:
1011₂ = 1×2³ + 0×2² + 1×2¹ + 1×2⁰

3. Octal (Base 8)

Used in some programming and low-level systems.
Digits: 0–7

4. Hexadecimal (Base 16)

Common in programming, memory addressing, color codes, and debugging.
Digits: 0–9, A–F
