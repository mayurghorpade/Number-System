# Number System
A number system is a structured method for representing numbers using a specific set of digits and a **base (radix)**.
Each number system defines:

* The digits it uses
* How place values increase
* How numbers are interpreted computationally

Number systems are essential in computing because machines operate using binary, while humans primarily use decimal.

## Types of Number Systems

### 1. Decimal Number System (Base 10)

* Digits: **0–9**
* Most commonly used in daily life
* Each position represents powers of 10

**Example:**
`543 = (5 × 10²) + (4 × 10¹) + (3 × 10⁰)`

---

### 2. Binary Number System (Base 2)

* Digits: **0, 1**
* Fundamental for computers and digital electronics
* Each position represents powers of 2

**Example:**
`1010₂ = (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (0 × 2⁰)`

---

### 3. Octal Number System (Base 8)

* Digits: **0–7**
* Used in low-level computing and Unix/Linux file permissions
* Each position represents powers of 8

**Example:**
`57₈ = (5 × 8¹) + (7 × 8⁰)`

---

### 4. Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16)

* Symbols: **0–9, A–F**
* A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15
* Used in memory addresses, color codes, debugging

**Example:**
`2F₁₆ = (2 × 16¹) + (15 × 16⁰)`
