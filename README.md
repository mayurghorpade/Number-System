What is a Number System?
A number system is a structured way of representing and expressing numbers using a set of digits and a base (radix). Each number system defines:

How many digits it uses

How place values increase

How numbers are interpreted computationally

Number systems are essential in computing because different systems are used internally by machines (binary), while humans typically use decimal.

Common Types of Number Systems
1. Decimal Number System (Base 10)
Uses 10 digits: 0–9

Most commonly used in daily life

Each position represents increasing powers of 10
Example: 543 = (5 × 10²) + (4 × 10¹) + (3 × 10⁰)

2. Binary Number System (Base 2)
Uses 2 digits: 0 and 1

Fundamental for computers and digital electronics

Each position represents powers of 2
Example: 1010₂ = (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (0 × 2⁰)

3. Octal Number System (Base 8)
Uses 8 digits: 0–7

Used in low-level computing and permissions in Unix/Linux

Each position represents powers of 8
Example: 57₈ = (5 × 8¹) + (7 × 8⁰)

4. Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16)
Uses 16 symbols: 0–9 and A–F

A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15

Widely used in memory addresses, color codes, and debugging
Example: 2F₁₆ = (2 × 16¹) + (15 × 16⁰)
